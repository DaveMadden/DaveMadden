# David Madden

👋 Hi, I'm David.
I'm a software engineer who stepped away from the profession for a decade to be a Navy SEAL Officer, but I never stopped making things. After the SEAL Teams I also founded/ran an HR SaaS startup for two years.<br>

## About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently building an AI-powered interactive video tutor with Kyron Learning.
- ⠕ Formerly at [Replit](www.replit.com) where I worked on things like:
  - bug triage bots
  - bug fixes
  - documentation (code and content)
  - changelog (code and content)
  - an in-app bug report form that enabled users to record their screens without leaving the app
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: GraphQL + Apollo
- 🤔 What I want to learn next: 
  - Rust ([carcinization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation) is real)
  - Go
  - Emacs (it's cool to build your own lightsaber)
  - Clojure (I love functional programming and am fascinated by the potential of a purpose-built FP language)
- 📫 How to reach me: superdavedadev at gmail
- ⚡ Fun fact: I built the SEAL Teams' rapid prototyping and tactical technology capability, so the SEAL Admiral referred to me as his ["Q"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)). Not only did I found and lead the unit for 5 years, but I also wrote the code that controlled classified payloads on all our projects - even as a Navy SEAL I was building things with code.


## 🔧 Tools I Love

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - also, [their new docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/) are *incredible*
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org)
