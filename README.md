# David Madden

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm David.
I'm a software engineer who stepped away from the profession for a decade to be a Navy SEAL Officer, but I never stopped making things. After the SEAL Teams I also founded/ran an HR SaaS startup for two years.<br>

## About Me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building an AI-powered interactive video tutor with Kyron Learning.
- â • Formerly at [Replit](www.replit.com) where I worked on internal tools like:
  - bug triage bots
  - documentation
  - changelog
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: GraphQL + Apollo
- ðŸ¤” What I want to learn next: Clojure (I love functional programming and am fascinated by the potential of a purpose-built FP language)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: superdavedadev at gmail
- âš¡ Fun fact: I built the SEAL Teams' rapid prototyping and tactical technology capability, so the SEAL Admiral referred to me as his ["Q"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)). Not only did I found and lead the unit for 5 years, but I also wrote the code that controlled classified payloads on all our projects - even as a Navy SEAL I was building things with code.


## ðŸ”§ Tools I Love

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org)
