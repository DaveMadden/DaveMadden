# David Madden

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm David.
I'm a software engineer who stepped away from the keyboard for a decade to be a Navy SEAL Officer.
But I'm back now and already building!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Typescript
- ðŸ¤” What I want to learn next: Rust + Clojure
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: superdavedadev at gmail
- âš¡ Fun fact: I built the SEAL Teams' rapid prototyping and tactical technology capability, so the SEAL Admiral referred to me as his ["Q"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(James_Bond))
