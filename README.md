# David Madden

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm David.
I'm a software engineer who stepped away from the keyboard for a decade to be a Navy SEAL Officer. <br>
I also founded/ran a startup for a few years (did not find PMF).<br>
                                   Now I'm back to building things and I love it!

## About Me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: a yet-to-be-named open-source Twitter clone built on a distributed web protocol called [Holochain](https://www.holochain.org).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Typescript
- ðŸ¤” What I want to learn next: Rust + Clojure
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: superdavedadev at gmail
- âš¡ Fun fact: I built the SEAL Teams' rapid prototyping and tactical technology capability, so the SEAL Admiral referred to me as his ["Q"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(James_Bond))
