# David Madden

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm David.
I'm a software engineer who stepped away from the profession for a decade to be a Navy SEAL Officer, but I never stopped making things. After the SEAL Teams I also founded/ran an HR SaaS startup for a few years.<br>

## About Me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: a yet-to-be-named open-source Twitter clone built on a distributed web protocol called [Holochain](https://www.holochain.org).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Typescript
- ðŸ¤” What I want to learn next: Rust + Clojure
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: superdavedadev at gmail
- âš¡ Fun fact: I built the SEAL Teams' rapid prototyping and tactical technology capability, so the SEAL Admiral referred to me as his ["Q"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)). Not only did I lead the unit for 5 years, but I also wrote the code that controlled classified payloads on all our projects. So even as a Navy SEAL I was building things with code.
